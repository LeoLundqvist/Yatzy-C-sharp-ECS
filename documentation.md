# Project Description
## Overview
The project aims to develop a Yatzy game using the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture in C#. Yatzy, also known as Yahtzee, is a popular dice game where players roll five dice to achieve specific combinations to score points. By implementing the game using ECS principles, we aim to create a scalable and flexible architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability and extensibility.

## Scope
The scope of the project encompasses the development of a fully playable Yatzy game with the following features:

   - Dice Rolling: Players can roll five dice at the beginning of their turn.
   - Scoring Mechanism: Implementing the scoring rules of Yatzy to calculate and display scores.
   - Turn-based Gameplay: Players take turns rolling dice and selecting scoring categories until all categories are filled.
   - User Interface: Designing a user-friendly interface to display the game state, dice rolls, and scorecard.
   - Game Logic: Implementing the core game logic to enforce rules and determine game outcomes.
## Objectives
The primary objectives of the project are as follows:

- ECS Implementation: Utilize the ECS architecture to design the game components, entities, and systems.
- Modularity and Extensibility: Design the architecture to allow easy addition of new features and modifications without significant code changes.
- Scalability: Ensure that the game architecture can handle potential expansions or enhancements in the future.
- Code Quality: Maintain clean, readable, and well-documented code following best practices and design patterns.
- User Experience: Prioritize user experience by creating an intuitive interface and providing clear instructions for playing the game.
By achieving these objectives, the project aims to deliver a robust and enjoyable Yatzy gaming experience for players while demonstrating the benefits of the ECS architecture in game development.

This overview sets the stage for understanding the project's goals, the approach to be taken, and the expected outcomes of implementing Yatzy using the ECS architecture.

# Requirements

## Project Overview

The ECS Yatzy game development project aims to create a fully playable Yatzy game using the Entity-Component-System architecture in C#. Yatzy, also known as Yahtzee, is a classic dice game where players roll five dice to achieve specific combinations and score points. The project focuses on implementing game mechanics, scoring rules, user interface, and testing strategies while adhering to ECS principles for modularity and extensibility.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Game Initialization**
   - The game should begin with a welcome screen offering options to start a new game, view instructions, or exit the application.

2. **Gameplay Mechanics**
   - Players should have the ability to roll five dice at the start of their turn.
   - The game interface should display the rolled dice and allow players to select which dice to keep and which to re-roll.
   - After each roll, players must choose a scoring category to allocate their score.
   - The game should enforce the standard Yatzy scoring rules for various combinations, including ones, twos, threes, etc., and handle special cases like Yahtzee bonuses.
   - Once all scoring categories are filled, the game should end, and final scores should be calculated and displayed.

3. **User Interface**
   - Develop a user-friendly interface that presents the game state, including dice rolls, scorecard, and current player turn.
   - Provide clear instructions and feedback to guide players through the game.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **ECS Implementation**
   - Design the game using the Entity-Component-System architecture to separate entities, components, and systems for improved modularity and flexibility.
   - Ensure that entities represent game objects, such as dice, players, and scores, while components encapsulate data and systems handle game logic.

2. **Modularity and Extensibility**
   - Implement the game architecture in a modular manner to facilitate easy addition of new features, scoring categories, or rule modifications.
   - Ensure that changes to one aspect of the game do not necessitate extensive modifications to other parts of the codebase.

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize game performance to ensure smooth gameplay and responsiveness across different devices and platforms.
   - Minimize computational overhead and resource usage while maintaining game integrity and functionality.

## Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Implement unit tests to validate the functionality of individual components, systems, and game logic.
   - Aim for a minimum code coverage of 80% to ensure thorough testing and identify potential issues early in the development process.

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Conduct integration tests to verify the interactions between different components and systems within the ECS architecture.
   - Ensure that all components work together seamlessly to deliver the intended gameplay experience.

## Documentation Requirements

1. **Developer Documentation**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation covering the game architecture, codebase, and development process.
   - Include guidelines and best practices for contributing to the project, such as coding standards, version control procedures, and collaboration tools.

2. **User Documentation**
   - Create user-friendly guides and instructions explaining how to play the game, navigate the interface, and understand scoring rules.
   - Ensure that users can easily access relevant information and troubleshoot common issues encountered during gameplay.

## Miscellaneous Requirements

1. **Git Repository Management**
   - Maintain a Git repository for version control, enabling collaborative development and tracking of code changes over time.
   - Follow best practices for commit messages, branch management, and repository organization to streamline development and ensure code quality.

2. **Grading Criteria**
   - Establish clear criteria for evaluating the project based on its functionality, performance, code quality, documentation, and adherence to ECS principles.
   - Align grading criteria with project objectives and stakeholder expectations to assess project success and identify areas for improvement.

These requirements outline the specific goals and criteria for the ECS Yatzy game development project, guiding the implementation process and ensuring the delivery of a high-quality and engaging gaming experience.
